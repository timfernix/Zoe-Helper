Title: match info question
Desc: I have a member in my server who was having issues executing the /create player command. Because of this I added this users account to the leaderboard myself and linked to their discord. The issue now is that users match history is not popping up. Is this normal or does it not show because that player didn’t link their account themselves. I’m not sure.

Title: Shorter notification title
Desc: Hey there!

I mainly use/see Zoé notifications on my phone or my watch, and the notification message for matches results is quite long. I feel like there is too much text for the given information, and could be shorter (specially now there is a tag appended to the summoner's name). 

For example, the message:

Aman Malik NA#ALIVE - 5v5 Ranked Flex | Summoner's Rift - Defeat

Could be:

Aman Malik NA#ALIVE - Ranked Flex - Defeat

No need to specify 5v5 nor the map, it's implicit from the game mode. I find it a lot easier to read, and it will fit on my watch screen or the sneak peak of phone's notification 👌🏻

Title: Zoe Bot doesn't show all Games
Desc: Hey Guys,
I'm now using Zoe Bot for a few Months and it all worked all fine until a few weeks ago. 
The Bot is not showing all Games me and the other registered users played plus the LP gain or loss.
It shows one game like 
,,player ... has lost ... LP (Solo/Duo)
Elo -> Elo
Recap of the Game" and then the Stats + Itembuild. But then it skips a few Games and randomly shows one Game again. Anyone got the same problem or know why it is that way? A few months ago, the Bot showed all games played.

THX in advance.

Title: Infochannel / leaderboards don't update despite using /refresh
Desc: Hi just wanted to add that when I was creating the info channel / leaderboard and then click quick refresh there's a chance where it will just freeze for hours on end. I tried to periodically /refresh every hour but nothing changes. I have to delete the info channel and then remake it again. Is this a known issue?~

Thanks

Title: Adding more info on game results screen
Desc: Hello ! Awesome bot, tried it yesterday and it became a banger for our server. For the match history, is it possible to get the "best" stat for the player, like %dmg share for carries or dmg/gold ?

Have a good day
