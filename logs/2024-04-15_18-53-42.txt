Title: Is there a way to limit the commands users can use?
Desc: For example, can user see the list of account registered to a specific discord user?

If so, is there a way so "normal" discord members cannot use such command and is only available to admins? 

Basically only allowing "normal" members to only be able to use /register and any other command are not available to them
